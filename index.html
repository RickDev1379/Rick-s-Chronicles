        <p>
            I am a  software engineer with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, where I have started my programming journey and develop.
        I am a Full Sail University Graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
        Over the course of my studies, I developed the ability to work in several programming languages, such as C#, C++, Dart, Flutter and Java.
        My primary concentration has been in Android development, where I have created many projects in Java and took on every task I was given to compile functional and user-friendly mobile apps.
        Since graduating, I continue to learn new skills, such as HTML and CSS. I inspire to contribute to the society's advancement by contributing in software that brings about some sort of change in our world. 
        I look forward to securing employment in software development which will allow me to balance my technical knowledge with passion for forward thinking to help shape the next generation of technology.
